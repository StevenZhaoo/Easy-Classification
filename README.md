# Easy Classification

> Author: Steven Zhao

## Prologue

Classification work practically run through all my research and development works. There are bunch
of processing like building models, train and evaluate the models, and process the data literally using
the same construction which I need to code every single time when I wanna reuse them. That the basic
motivation of starting this repo. What I wanna do is constructing basic elements for classification
work to free me from re-coding similar models.

## Working Plan

- [ ] RNN w/ GRU
- [ ] RNN w/ LSTM
- [ ] Transformer
- [ ] GNN
- [ ] Attention
- [ ] PLMs from [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
